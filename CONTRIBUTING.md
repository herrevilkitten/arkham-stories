Rule changes should go in the `Advanced Rules` section.  Alternate systems or stories should be placed in an appendix -- until we get
a branching strategy set up.

For example, a rule that allows you to take 2 points of Injury or Insanity in exchange for an automatic success would go under
`Advanced Rules`.  Changes that locked the story to a deep sea research station would go in the appendix or a new branch.
